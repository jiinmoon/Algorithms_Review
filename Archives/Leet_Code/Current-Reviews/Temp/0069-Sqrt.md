# 69. Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only
the integer part of the result is returned.

#### (1) Brute Force.

Iterate every number upto x to check whether its product can produce x. O(x) in
time complexity.

#### (2) Binary Search.

We can think of this problem as a searching for a value in between 1, x whose
product to itself produces x. Thus, we can use binary search to search for this
value in O(log(n)).

#### (3) Newton's Method.

We can use Newton's method to converge on the best guess. O(log(x)) in time
complexity.

Java: Newton's Method.

```java

class Solution69 {

    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        
        if (x < 2)
            return x;
        
        double prev = x, next = (prev + x / prev) / 2.0;
        
        for (; Math.abs(prev - next) >= 1;
            prev = next,
            next = (prev + x / prev) / 2.0);
        
        return (int) next;
    }
}

```
