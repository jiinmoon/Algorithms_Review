# 15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that
a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of
zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

#### (1) Brute Force.

Naive approach would be to consider every value against each other with nested
loop; this would be O(n^3) in time complexity.

#### (2) Sort, then two-pointers.

By sorting the given array first, we can use the two pointers to efficiently
select two elements (b, c) for every a. This can reduce the time complexity to
O(n^2) as for every a chosen, we can select b, c in O(n) time.

Java: Sort, then two-pointers.

```java

class Solution15 {

    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums)
    {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();

        Arrays.sort(nums);

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++)
        {
            if (i > 0 and nums[i-1] == nums[i])
                continue;

            int l = i + 1, j = nums.length - 1;
            
            while (l < r) 
            {
                int currSum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r];

                if (currSum == 0) {
                    result.add(List.of(nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]));
                    while (l++ < r and nums[l] == nums[l-1]);
                    while (l < r-- and nums[r] == nums[r+1]);
                } else if (currSum < 0) {
                    l++;
                } else {
                    r--;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
