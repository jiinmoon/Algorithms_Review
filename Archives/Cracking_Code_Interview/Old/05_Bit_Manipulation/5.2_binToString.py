""" 5.2 Binary To String


Question:

    Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.72) that is passed in as a
    double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented
    accurately in binary with at most 32 char, report error.

---

The particular question asks for how to represent the floating point number
within the binary system with mantissa.
