""" 4.8 First Common Ancestor


Question:

    Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two
    nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure.
    This is not necessarily a BST.

---

Suppose that we have given node p and q; and have to find where their paths
converge up in the binary tree. First is treat this as a finding the
intersection of two linked list.
