# 4.4 Check Balanced

Implement a function to check whether binary tree is balanced.

---

Modify the height algorithm for binary tree - at each node we return maximum
height from left and right. Compare the diff and if it is greater than 1, we
have imbalance.

---

Python:

```python

def checkBalance(root):

    if not root:
        return True

    def helper(node):
        if not node:
            return 0

        l, r = helper(node.left), helper(node.right)

        if l == r == -1 or abs(l - r) > 1:
            return -1

        return max(l, r) + 1

    return helper(root) != -1

```
