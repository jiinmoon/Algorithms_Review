# 4.3 List of Depths

Given a binary tree, design an algorithm that creates a linked list of all
nodes at each depths.

---

Simple approach would be using BFS which would traverse the given binary tree
depth by depth. At each depth, we iterate to create a linked list for given
contents of queue.

---

Python:

```python

def createLevelLinkedList(root):
    
    if not root:
        return []


    result = list()
    q = [ root ]

    while q:

        result.append(q.copy())

        temp = list()
        for node in q:
            if node.left:
                temp.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                temp.append(node.right)
        q = temp

    return result

```
