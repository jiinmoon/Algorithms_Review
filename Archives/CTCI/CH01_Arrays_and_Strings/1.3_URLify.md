# 1.3 URLify

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". Assume that string
has sufficient enough space at the end to hold the additional characters, and
given "true" length of the string.

---

Simply iterate from behind, adding in the additional characters as white spaces
are encountered. Alternatively, with language like Python or with help of
extensive string manipulation library, we could use regex substition method if
it is made available.

Python: using Regex;

```python

import re

def URLify(s):

    return re.sub(" ", "%20, s.strip()) 
```
