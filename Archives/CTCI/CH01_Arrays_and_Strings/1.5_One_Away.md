# 1.5 One Away

There are three types of edits that can be performed on the strings: insert,
delete, or replace a char. Given two strings, write a function to check if they
are one or zero edit away

---

There are two general appraoches which is same in principle: just edit where
discrepency is and check for equaility. Either iterate on the smaller string,
and insert a character that is missing from larger string; or we iterate on the
larger string and delete a character that is present.

---

Python:

```python

def isOneEditAway(s1, s2):
    if s1 == s2 or abs(len(s1) - len(s2)) >= 2:
        return s1 == s2
    elif len(s1) > len(s2):
        return isOneEditAway(s2, s1)

    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            temp = list(s1)
            temp = temp[:i] + s2[i] + temp[i:]
            return "".join(temp) == s2
    return False
```
