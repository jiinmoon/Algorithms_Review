# 1.7 Rotate Matrix

Given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel is 4 bytes,
write a method to rotate this image by 90 degrees in-place.

We could approach this problem as a matrix transformation problem - detailed
information at
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1676441/how-to-rotate-the-positions-of-a-matrix-by-90-degrees.

Another method is to go through layer by layer, swapping the positions at each
index.

Best method would be to first transpose the matrix - swapping across the
diagonal line and mirror column-wise. Similary, we could also first mirror
row-wise then transpose the matrix.

Python:

```python

def rotate(matrix):

    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return matrix

    matrix.reverse()

    for i in range(1, len(matrix)):
        for j in range(i, len(matrix[0]):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

    return matrix
```
