# 1.2 Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of other.

---

Here, meaning of permutation is the key - basically, this refers to whether one
string is composed of all the characters from another. Hence, one approach
would be to count all characters from each strings to check whether they match
up. This would be O(n) in time complexity and O(n) in space required to store
count information. Alternatively, we can try to sort the strings in-place to
see whether two strings are identical, but this would increase time complexity
to O(n * log(n)) whilist space requirement reduces to O(1) given in-place
sorting method is used.

Python:

```python

def checkPermutation(s1, s2):

    counter1 = collections.Counter(s1)

    for char in s2:
        if char in counter1 and counter[char] == 0 or char not in counter:
            return False
        counter1[char] -= 1

    return True
```
