# 1.6 String Compression

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of
repeated characters. If the compressed string would not become smaller, your
method should return the original instead. String has both upper and lowercase
letters.

---

We count each characters as we iterate and try to build the compressed string.
Then, check the length of the resulting compressed string against the original.

---

Python:

```python

def stringCompression(original):

    count, compressed = 0, list()

    for i, char in enumerate(original):
        count += 1
        # end of char or new char is found
        if i >= len(original) - 1 or char != original[i+1]:
            result.append(char + str(count))
            count = 0

    return original if len(result) >= len(original) else "".join(result)
```
