# 2.3 Delete Middle Node

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle, given access only to
that node.

---

Simply we move over next value to current, then delete the next duplicate node.

---

Python:

```python

def deleteMid(node):

    if not node or not node.next:
        return node

    node.val = node.next.val
    node.next = node.next.next

    return node
```
