# 2.5 Sum Lists

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains
a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order. Write a function to
adds two numbers and return result as a linked list.

---

We use carry variable to add from least significant digit - and carry over the
remaining to next. This process is repeated until we run out of both or carry
remains.

Python:

```python

def sum(l1, l2):

    if not (l1 and l2):
        return l1 or l2

    dummy = prev = ListNode(None)
    carry = 0

    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        if l1:
            carry += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2:
            carry += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        prev.next = ListNode(carry % 10)
        carry //= 10
        prev = prev.next

    return dummy.next

```
