# 2.4 Partition

Write code to partition a linked list around a value of x, such that all nodes
less than x come before those which are greater or equal to x.

---

We prepare two new heads of the list, and iterate on the original list. One
list maintains the nodes whose values are less than x and vice versa. Then, we
concatenate two lists into one. Alternatively, we could use a single list where
we maintain the head and tail, and expand out to left and right depending on
the values encountered.

---

Python:

```python

def partition(head, X):

    if not head:
        return head

    leftDummy = left = ListNode(None)
    rightDummy = right = ListNode(None)

    while head:
        if head.val < X:
            left.next = head
        else:
            right.next = head
        head = head.next

    left.next = rightDummy.next

    return leftDummy.next

```
