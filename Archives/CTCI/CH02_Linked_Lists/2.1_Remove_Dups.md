# 2.1 Remove Dups

Write a code to remove duplicate elements from an unsorted linked list. Can you
solve without additional space?

---

If we can have additional space, we could simply create a new head of the
linked list, and append only the nodes from the original which are
non-duplicates by creating a hashmap or a record data structure to note the
previous seen elements. This is both O(n) in time and in space complexity.

If not, then we have to iterate multiple times for each element to check for
whether duplicate exists or not. This would be O(n^2) in time complexity, but
can be done in-place.

Python: hash-set approach;

```python

def removeDups(head):

    seen = set()
    curr = head

    while curr:
        if curr.val in seen:
            prev.next = curr.next
        else:
            seen.add(curr.val)
            prev = curr
        curr = curr.next

    return head
```

Python: O(1) space approach;

```python

def removeDups(head):

    curr = head

    while curr:
        # iterate forward to remove all duplicates til end
        runner = curr
        while runner.next:
            if runner.next.val == curr.val:
                runner.next = runner.next.next
            else:
                runner = runner.next
        curr = curr.next

    return head

```
