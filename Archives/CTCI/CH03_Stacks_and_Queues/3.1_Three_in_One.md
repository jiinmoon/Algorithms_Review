# 3.1 Three in One

Describe how you may use a single array to implement three stacks.

---

We partition given array into three buckets; (0, n/3), (n/3, 2n/3), (2n/3, n).
Then, we treat each buckets as a individual stack. The problem is whether we
wish to decide whether this structure should be dynamic - as in we should be
able to expand upon once capacity has been reached. If so, then we maintain the
capacity of the each stack, then once it is reached, we allocate an larger
array, move over the previous elements to new array, and adjust the pointers.
