# 15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that
a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of
zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

---

Naive approach here is to brute force comparison of every element - choose
every possible combination of a, b and c. This nested loop approach will be
O(n^3) in time complexity.

We can reduce the time complexity to O(n^2) if we can use two pointer method by
first sorting the given array of integers. By sorting the numbers, for every
element a, we can find whether there exists satisfying elements b and c in
linear time. Hence, O(n * log(n)) to initally sort then O(n^2) to find the all
unique triplets - overall, O(n^2) in time complexity.

Python: Sort then two pointer method.

```python

class Solution15:

    def find3Sum(self, nums, target):
        
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return []

        if len(nums) == 3 and sum(nums) == target:
            return nums

        nums.sort()

        result = []

        for i, a in enumerate(nums):
            # avoid choosing duplicate element
            if i > 0 and nums[i-1] == a:
                continue
            
            # j is pointer for element b
            # k is pointer for element c
            j, k = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while j < k:
                curr = [a, nums[j], nums[k]]
                
                if sum(curr) == target:
                    result.append(curr)
                    j += 1
                    k -= 1
                    # avoid choosing duplicate element
                    while j < k and nums[j] == nums[j-1]: j += 1
                    while j < k and nums[k] == nums[k+1]: k -= 1
                elif sum(curr) < target:
                    j += 1
                else:
                    k -= 1
        
        return result
```
