# 50. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e. xn).

---

A logrithmic trick to computing the power is take every power of 2 if we can.
First chapter in SICP also explores this.

Python:

```python

class Solution50:

    def pow(self, x, n):

        def helper(x, n):
            if not n:
                return 1
            
            result = helper(x, n // 2)
            result *= result
            
            return result if n % 2 == 0 else result * x

        sign = n < 0
        result = helper(x, abs(n))
        
        # edge case where x is raised to power of negative integer
        return 1 / result if sign else result
```
