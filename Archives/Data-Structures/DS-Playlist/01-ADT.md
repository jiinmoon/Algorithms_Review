01 Abstract Data Types
======================


What is a Data Structure?
-------------------------

It is a way of organizing data such that it can be used and manipulated
efficienctly.

Practically, they are building blocks for powering the fast algorithms, manage
complex data, and maintain cleaner code base.

When is it appropriate to use certain data structure?


ADT vs DS
---------

ADT is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to
which a data structure must adhere to.

There is no implementation detail - just the outline of what operations must be
supported.

For example, we may have a List ADT that is implemented with Dynamic Array or
Linked List. Likewise, Queue ADT can be Linked List based, Array based. or Stack
based.
