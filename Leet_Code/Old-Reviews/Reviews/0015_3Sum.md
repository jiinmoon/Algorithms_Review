15 3Sum
=======

Question:
---------

Given an array S of n integers, are there three elements a, b and c such that
they sum to zero?

Find all unique triplets in the array.

Note: the solution set must not contain duplicate sets.

Solutions:
---------

Any k-sum problem can be seen as an extension of a typical 2-Sum problem.
First, we will sort the array in order to imposea directionality. This will
give us a way to choose our elements depending on our current value using two
pointer method.

The slight complication here is that the solution does not want us to include
any duplicate sets. The easiest way to deal with it would be to use an
immutable tuple and use the `set` data structure in the case of Python. But in
general, we should simply move the pointers until it is not same as the
previously picked elements.

Codes:
------

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        m = len(nums)-1
        result = []
        nums.sort()

        for i in range(m-2):
            if (i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]):
                continue
            j = i+1
            k = m-1
            while j < k:
                candidates = (nums[i], nums[j], nums[k])
                sumcandidates = sum(candidates)
                if not sumCandidates:
                    result.append(candidates)
                    j += 1
                    k -= 1
                    while j < k and nums[j] == nums[j-1]:
                        j += 1
                    while j < k and nums[k] == nums[k+1]:
                        k -= 1
                elif sumCandidates < 0:
                    j += 1
                else:
                    k -= 1
        return result
```
