# 50. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e. xn).

---

We can reduce the amount of work by realizing the if the n is evenly divisible
(is even) then we can reduce the work by n / 2. If the n is odd, then we can
simply raise it a single time more. As n can be negative, it should be checked
in the beginning. Since we are possible reducing the size by half in each
recursive call, the time complexity reduces to O(log(n)).

Python:

```python

class Solution:
    def pow(self, x, n):
        def helper(x, n):
            if not n:
                return 1
            result = helper(x, n // 2)
            result *= result
            return result * x if n % 2 else result

        isNeg = n < 0
        result = helper(x, abs(n))
        return 1/result if isNeg else result
```
