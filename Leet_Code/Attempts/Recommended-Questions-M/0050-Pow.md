# 50. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e. x^n).

---

A simplest method would be to repeatedly multiply x by n number of times. But
if we examine it closely, we can isolate the case where the n is an even or
odd. If it is even, we can compute the case of x raised to power of half of n.
Otherwise, we multiply the result by additional x. With this approach, we can
reduce the time complexity to O(log(n)).

Python:

```python

class Solution:
    def pow(self, x, n):
        def helper(x, n):
            if n == 0:
                return 1
            result = self.helper(x, n // 2)
            result *= result
            return result if n % 2 == 0 else result * x

        isNeg = n < 0
        result = helper(x, abs(n))
        return 1/result if isNeg else result
```
