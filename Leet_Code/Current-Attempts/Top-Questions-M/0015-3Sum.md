# 15 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that
a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of
zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Any generalized, finding k-Sum problem can be viewed as an expansion upon the
finding two sum using sorting method. Once we sort the integers, we have
a directionality as to which value that we can select on next iteration.

The problem here is in avoiding selecting the duplicate triplets - for this, we
avoid choosing a value that we have selected in previous iteration.

Python:

```python

class Solution:
    def findThreeSum(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        result = list()

        for i in range(len(nums)-2):
            if i != 0 and nums[i-1] == nums[i]:
                continue
            j = i + 1
            k = len(nums) - 1
            while j < k:
                curr = [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
                if not sum(curr):
                    result.append(curr)
                    j += 1
                    k -= 1
                    while j < k and nums[j] == nums[j-1]: j += 1
                    while j < k and nums[k] == nums[k+1]: k -= 1
                if sum(curr) < 0:
                    j += 1
                else:
                    k -= 1

        return result
```
