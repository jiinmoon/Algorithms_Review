# 3.5 Sort Stack

Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top.
You may use additional temporary stack but do not copy elements over.

---

We maintain one stack in a sorted fashion; from unsorted stack, we remove the
top to place it in the sorted stack. We do this by repeatedly removing the top
of the sorted stack unto unsorted stack to find its sorted place.

---

Python:

```python

def stackSort(unsortedStack):

    sortedStack = list()

    while unsortedStack:

        toSort = unsortedStack.pop()

        while sortedStack and sortedStack[-1] > toSort:
            unsortedStack.append(sortedStack.pop())
        
        sortedStack.append(unsortedStack)

    return sortedStack

```
