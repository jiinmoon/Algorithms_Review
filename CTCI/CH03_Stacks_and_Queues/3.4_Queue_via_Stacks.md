# 3.4 Queue vis Stacks

Implement a Queue by using two stacks.

---

To implment FIFO nature of Queue by LIFO stacks, let us examine which
operations need to happen.

Enqueue operation should place the element at the end of the our queue. And
dequeue operation should remove the front of our queue.

If we are to do this using stack, then when we enqueue, we also push unto our
stack. But now when we dequeue, our front element is placed at the bottom of
our stack - hence, we need to pop from all of our stacks to reach for that
element - the last element in our stack.

So, we have two options; we can make our enqueue or dequeue expensive O(n)
operations; but other can remain O(1).

We do this by dedicating a stack only for dequeue; when we enqueue, we push
unto our stack1 normally. When we have to dequeue, we remove from stack2; if it
is empty, we move over elements from stack1 unto stack2.

Python:

```python

class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = list()
        self.stack2 = list()

    def enqueue(self, val):
        self.stack1.append(val)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2.pop()

```
