# 3.2 Stack Min

Design a stack that has a min function which returns the current minimum of the
stack.

---

We can solve this problem by implement our stack with two stacks - one to
maintain our variables as a normal stack and other to maintain the current
minimum.

When we push unto our stack, we check against the minStack first - if the new
value is the new minimum, we can add to minStack.

When we pop from stack, we also check against the minStack - if it is the top
of the minStack (current minimum), we also remove from minStack.

By doing so, we can always maintain current minimum at the top of our minStack.

Python:

```python

class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stk = []
        self.minStk = []

    def push(self, val):
        if self.minStk and self.minStk[-1] > val:
            self.minStk.append(val)
        self.stk.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.stk:
            return None
        val = self.stk.pop()
        if self.minStk and self.minStk[-1] == val:
            self.minStk.pop()
        return val

    def getMin(self):
        return self.minStk[-1] if self.minStk else None
```
