# 4.2 Minimal Tree

Given a sorted array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create
a binary search tree with minimal height.

---

Given sorted array, by taking its mid as a root, we can evenly divide the tree
into equal halves to its left and right which fits the description of the BST.
This process is repeated recursively and applied to all subtrees.

---

Python:

```python

def buildMinimalTree(nums):

    def helper(nums):
        if not nums:
            return None
        
        mid = len(nums) // 2
        node = TreeNode(nums[mid])
        node.left = helper(nums[:mid])
        node.right = helper(nums[mid+1:])

        return node

    return helper(nums)

```
