# 4.1 Route Between Nodes

Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find whether there is a path
between two nodes.

---

We can use either dfs or bfs algorithm to discover path between two nodes.
Here, we use bidirectional bfs.

---

Python:

```python

def search(start, end, graph):

    # graph is a dictionary of list {node : [neighbours]}

    front, back, visited = {start}, {end}, {}

    while front:
        newfront = set()

        for node in front:
            visited.add(node)
            for neigh in graph[node]:
                if neigh in back:
                    return True
                if neigh not in visited:
                    newfront.add(neigh)

        if not newfront:
            return False

        if len(front) > len(back):
            front, back = back, newfront
        else:
            front = newfront

    return False
```
