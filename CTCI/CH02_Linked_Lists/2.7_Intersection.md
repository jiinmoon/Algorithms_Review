# 2.7 Intersection

Given two linked lists, determine if two lists intersect - and return the
intersecting node.

---

Here, we can iterate on both of the list in a circle. If there exists a cycle
or intersection, they should arrive at that same point. Otherwise, both would
arrive at end of list and reach null.

---

Python:

```python

def isCycle(l1, l2):

    if not (l1 or l2):
        return

    slow, fast = l1, l2
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next if slow else l2
        fast = fast.next if fast else l1

    return slow

```
