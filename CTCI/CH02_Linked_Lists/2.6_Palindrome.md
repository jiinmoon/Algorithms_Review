# 2.6 Palindrome

Implement a function to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

---

Simple approach would be to find the half-way point then start our iteration
from head and mid-point to check for palindrome. To do this in a single
iteration, we can while looking for mid-point, reverse the first half of the
list.

---

Python:

```python

def isPalindromeList(head):

    curr = runner = head
    prev = None
    
    # reverse process; prev is new head of reversed first half
    while runner and runner.next:
        temp = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = temp
        runner = runner.next.next

    # odd case; skip over
    if runner:
        curr = curr.next

    # start matching from beginning
    while prev:
        if prev.val != curr.val:
            return False
        prev = prev.next
        curr = curr.next

    return True
```
