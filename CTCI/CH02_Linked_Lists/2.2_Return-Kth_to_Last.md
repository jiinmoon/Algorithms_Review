# 2.2 Return Kth to Last

Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

---

Not knowing the length of the linked list beforehand, we first appear to have
to iterate one to determine the total length in order to find the kth node.
However, we can complete this in a single scan if we use extra runner that has
been position Kth place forward; hence, when current and runner moves at the
same pace, when runner reaches the end, we have our current placed at Kth
place.

---

Python:

```python

def kthFromLast(head, K):

    current = runner = head
    for _ in range(K):
        if not runner:
            return -1
        runner = runner.next

    while runner:
        current = current.next
        runner = runner.next

    return current
```
