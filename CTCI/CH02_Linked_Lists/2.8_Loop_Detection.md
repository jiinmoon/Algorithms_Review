# 2.8 Loop Detection

Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at
the beginning of the loop.

---

Here, we may use the Floyd's Cycle detection algorithm - if there is a cycle,
two pointers that moving at the different speeds would arrive at the same
place. To find the beginning of the loop, we start from the head, and iterate
forward to where intersection has been found. This is because where two
pointers will meet will be placed at Kth to last step from the beginning of the
loop.

---

Python:

```python

def findLoop(head):

    if not head:
        return

    slow = fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next

        # intersection found; move to beginning of loop
        if fast == slow:
            while head != fast:
                head = head.next
                fast = fast.next
                return fast
    
    return
```
