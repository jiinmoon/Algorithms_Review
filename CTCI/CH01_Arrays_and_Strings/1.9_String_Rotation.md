# 1.9 String Rotation

Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of
another. Given two strings, can you check one string is rotated version of
another by calling this method once?

Rotating an list means that there was a break-point where elements were
shifted. Suppose s1 can be represented as a two halves where it broke and
shifted: s1 = "XY". Then, its shifted version should be of the form "YX". To
check for this, we can consider concatenated s1, "XYXY"; then it must follow
that shifted string "YX" be presented as a substring within this string.

```
s1 = "ABC", s2 = "CAB"

"CAB" in "ABCABC"
```

Python:

```python

def isRotated(s1, s2):

    return s2 in s1 + s1

```
