# 1.4 Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of
a palindrome.

---

In other words, the question is about checking that string can be rearranged to
form a palindrome. We can form a palindrome iff we have either 0 or 1 odd
unique character and even number of characters present.

Python:

```python

def isPalindromePermutation(s):

    counter = collections.Counter(s)
    
    seenOdd = False

    for char, count in counter.items():
        # ignore even counted characters
        if count % 2 == 0:
            continue
        # if it is odd, this should be the first case
        elif count % 2:
            return False
        seenOdd = True

    return True
```
