# 1.8 Zero Matrix

Write an algorithm such that if an element in a matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to 0.

Naively (or greedily) iterate to set row and col to 0 once an element is found
to be 0 has consequence of erasing the information about subsequent future
operations - and most likely to set entire matrix to 0.

Then, we should first iterate to record all the rows and cols which should be
set to 0. This would take additional space O(n).

However, we can store this information within the matrix itself so long as we
first record the fact that whether first row and col should be set to 0 as
well. By doing so, we can reduce the space requirement to constant.

Python:

```python

def zeroMatrix(matrix):

    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return matrix

    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

    setFirstRowZero = 0 in matrix[0]
    setFirstColZero = any(not matrix[i][0] for i in range(m))

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if not matrix[i][j]:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0

    for i in range(m):
        if matrix[i][0] == 0:
            for j in range(1, n):
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if matrix[0][i] == 0:
            for j in range(1, m):
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    if setFirstRowZero:
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[0][i] = 0

    if setFirstColZero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0

    return matrix
```
