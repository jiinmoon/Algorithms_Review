# 50. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

---

Naive approach to the computing the power of x to the n would be linear in time
complexity proportional to the size of n as we have to multiply n number of
times.

However, we can reduce the size of n by half at each step whilst multiply x by
itself. Hence, the problem actually becomes O(log(n)) instead.

Python:

```python

class Solution50:

    def pow(self, x, n):

        def helper(x, n):
            if not n:
                return 1
            
            result = helper(x, n // 2)
            result *= result

            # odd or even case of n
            return result if n % 2 == 0 else result * n

        result = helper(x, abs(n))

        return 1/result if n < 0 else result
```
