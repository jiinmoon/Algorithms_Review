# 15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that
a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of
zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Any x number of finding elements that would sum to certain value can be
generalized into k sum problem where we use nested loop to choose
k - 2 elements, and then select the two other elements in linear time so long
as the given arrya is sorted. By doing so, we can reduce the time complexity to
O(min(log(n) * n, n^k - 1)).

We could also introduce further contrainsts to potentially improve the time
complexity as for each iteration of choosing the values for a, b, c, ... k we
can find the absolute minimum and maximum value for each iteration. Hence,
before we start the iteration, we check for the boundary condition to see
whether the elements can even be found within such iteration.

Edge case here would be to avoid selecting the duplicate entries - to do so, we
avoid selecting the same value for each elements chosen.

Python:

```python

class Solution15:

    def findThreeSum(self, nums, target):

        nums.sort()

        result = []
        m = len(nums)

        for i in range(m - 2):
            if i > 0 and nums[i - 1] == nums[i]:
                continue
            j, k = i + 1, m - 1
            while j < k:
                curr = [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
                
                if sum(curr) == target:
                    result.append(curr)
                    j += 1
                    k -= 1
                    while j < k and nums[j] == nums[j - 1]: j += 1
                    while j < k and nums[k] == nums[k + 1]: k -= 1
                elif sum(curr) < target:
                    j += 1
                else:
                    k -= 1

        return result
```
